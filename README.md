# Hello there!

I'm Eduardo Espadeiro, and I've recently graduated with a Master's in Computer Science and Engineering at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico.
- My main interests are programming languages and compilers
- I enjoy both functional and low level programming (because of this I really like Rust :D)
- In my master's thesis, I implemented a Metaobject Protocol for the Julia programming language
